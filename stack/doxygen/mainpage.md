# DASH7 Alliance Protocol open source stack # {#mainpage}

## What is the DASH7 Alliance Protocol ##

DASH7 is an open source active RFID standard for wireless sensor networking, which operates in the sub-GHz unlicensed ISM and SRD bands (433, 868 and 915 MHz). DASH7 provides multi-year battery life, range of up to 2 km, indoor location with 1 meter accuracy, low latency for connecting with moving things, a very small open source protocol stack, AES 128-bit shared key encryption support, and data transfer of up to 200 kbit/s. DASH7 Alliance Protocol is the name of the protocol promoted by the non-profit consortium called the DASH7 Alliance.

## What is the goal of OSS-7 ##

The goal of the project is to provide a reference implementation of the DASH7 Alliance Protocol. This implementation should focus on completeness, correctness and being easy to understand. Performance and code size are less important aspects. For clarity a clear separation between the ISO layers is maintained in the code.
